Hangzhou:
"Smart." That's the unanimous first impression at the 19th Asian Games, and it's no surprise when you're in what's known as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) headquarters - Hangzhou. China proudly presents the 19th edition of the Asiad as the "Smart" Games.

Hangzhou boasts a unique blend of historical landscapes, like the ancient West Lake, which has inspired poets since the 9th century. It's a city that seamlessly combines its rich cultural heritage from the Silk Road era with cutting-edge technology.

As you explore the Games, it often feels like a "Technology Fair" from bottom to top, at least until the on-field competition takes over after the opening ceremony on September 23. The Main Media Centre (MMC) is a digital marvel that can leave tech enthusiasts overwhelmed.

Inside the MMC, a robot can answer your banking queries, and another one can transport goods while politely warning, "please be careful." The AI-generated image kiosk lets you request related images to display on a massive digital screen, showcasing AI's impact on broadcasting.

At the venues, if you can't find your seat, the "Smart Hangzhou 2022" app will guide you. Even the Tonglu Equestrian Centre has a "digital twin" that monitors various aspects, including energy conservation.

Language barriers are a thing of the past, thanks to volunteers using AI-enabled applications to translate and assist foreign guests.

But that's not all. The Games have also integrated:
1. 5G-Advanced: Transferring data at speeds ten times faster than standard 5G.
2. Passive IoT (Internet of things): Monitoring environmental conditions, logistics, asset inventory, and security.
3. Driverless buses: Using autonomous driving technology in Deqing, the co-host city.
