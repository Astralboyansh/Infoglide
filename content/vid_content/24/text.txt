NEW DELHI: 
Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, made a visit to Anand Vihar railway station in Delhi. During his time there, he engaged with porters, delving into their concerns and issues. To show his support, the former Congress president even wore the attire of a porter, which included a red shirt, and lifted luggage over his head.
"People's hero Rahul Gandhiji met his porter friends at the Anand Vihar railway station in Delhi today. Recently, a video had gone viral in which the porter friends of the railway station had expressed their desire to meet him," the Congress stated in a post on social media.
Rahul's visit comes several months after a group of porters had urged him to meet with them to gain a better understanding of their challenges and to work towards their betterment.
Last month, the Congress leader visited Leh-Ladakh and engaged in conversations with local residents. In May, the Congress MP embarked on a late-night truck ride from Delhi to Chandigarh. During this journey, he conversed with truck drivers at a dhaba, aiming to grasp the difficulties they encounter.
