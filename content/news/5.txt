Chandrayaan-3: Isro waiting to hear from Vikram &amp; Pragyan
BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which gave the command to put Chandrayaan-3 lander (Vikram) and rover (Pragyan) in sleep mode on September 3, is waiting to see if they wake up again as the Sun rose again on Moon.âIt would have been easy if there was a way we could know if they would wake up, but we have to wait and see how systems behave after Sunrise,â Isro chairman S Somanath told TOI.

The temperature has to rise above a certain threshold too. For the wake up, we need power generation and temperature on the elements on Vikram and Pragyan to meet certain criteria. We should know something by September 21 or 22. If they wake up, itâll wake up during this time,â M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre, the Chandrayaan-3 lead centre, told TOI.Multiple Isro scientists TOI spoke with reiterated that Vikram and Pragyan waking would be a bonus and that the data the two have sent when they were awake is expected to give new information given that all earlier in situ experiments were carried out in the equatorial region of the Moon.Both Vikram and Pragyan have achieved their primary mission objectives of soft-landing on Moon, roving on its surface and conducting in situ experiments. In fact, Vikram even performed a short lunar hop which Isro termed was beyond the initial mission objectives.
