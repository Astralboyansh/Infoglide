The current-gen Himalayan boasts a 411 cc single-cylinder air-oil cooled engine, churning out 24 hp power. In contrast, the new Himalayan is expected to sport a larger 452 cc liquid-cooled engine, delivering approximately 40 hp of power and 45 Nm of torque. This powerhouse will be paired with a 6-speed gearbox.

Previous test mules have given us a glimpse of the motorcycle's LED turn indicators, a new rear rack, and dual-purpose tires that seem slightly more road-oriented compared to the current-gen model.

The 2023 Royal Enfield Himalayan is anticipated to be officially unveiled in November, with pricing details to follow shortly after. While the current model starts at Rs 2.16 lakh (ex-showroom), the new Himalayan is expected to command a higher price, given its modern updates, including the new powertrain, platform, suspension setup, and advanced technology.
