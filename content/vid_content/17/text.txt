Pak's general elections to be held in last week of Jan 2024
New Delhi: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) made a significant announcement on Thursday. They declared that the general elections in Pakistan will take place in the last week of January 2024, according to a report by Dawn News.
The ECP released a statement, confirming the completion of its review of the constituency delimitation process. They have also decided that the initial list for constituency delimitation will be officially released on September 27.
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar addressed concerns about the border situation in Pakistan. He stated that while the situation on Pakistan's borders is "alarming," it will not hinder the holding of general elections in the country.
The ECP further explained their timeline, stating, "After hearing objections and suggestions regarding the exercise, the final list would be issued on November 30. Following that, there will be a 54-day election program, and polls will be held in the last week of January 2024."
Political unrest has gripped Pakistan since April 2022, following the removal of former Prime Minister Imran Khan from office through a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Khan was arrested in early August on corruption charges and sentenced to three years in prison after a court conviction.
Pakistan is also in the process of redrawing its electoral boundaries to align with the most recent census data.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed concerns about the potential for institutions to manipulate the electoral process. They emphasized the importance of completing the delimitation of constituencies quickly and efficiently, without using it as an excuse to delay the elections further.
