There is degree of prejudice in Trudeau's allegations: MEA
New Delhi:
India, on Thursday, responded to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations regarding the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, labeling his charges as "politically motivated." The Ministry of External Affairs highlighted a degree of prejudice in Trudeau's statements and emphasized that Canada had not shared any specific information on the Hardeep Singh Nijjar case with India.
Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India, was fatally shot outside a Gurdwara in a parking area in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, on June 18.
"We are willing to consider any specific information provided to us, but as of now, we have not received any specific information from Canada," stated Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, during a press briefing on Thursday.
Expect reduction in Canada's diplomatic presence in India:
The Ministry of External Affairs hinted at the possibility of reducing the number of Canadian diplomats in India. They pointed out that Canada's diplomatic presence in India currently exceeds that of India in Canada. The MEA emphasized the need for parity in strength and rank equivalence between both countries.
"The MEA expects Canada to address India's concerns regarding terrorism and anti-India activities originating from Canadian soil. We have shared specific information with Canada regarding such activities conducted on their soil," the MEA spokesperson added.
Temporary suspension of visas for Canadian applicants in third countries:
Visa services for Canadians have been temporarily suspended until further notice. The Indian High Commission and consulates in Canada are currently unable to process visa applications due to disruptions caused by security concerns. This temporary suspension also applies to Canadian applicants in third countries.
