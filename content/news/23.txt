Khalistani extremist Sukhdool Singh killed in gang-war in Canada
NEW DELHI: Gangster-turned-terrorist Sukhdool Singh alias Sukha Duneke was allegedly bumped off by unidentified gunmen in Canada on Wednesday, intelligence sources said citing inputs coming in from Canada on Thursday morning. An official confirmation from the local law enforcement is awaited on the murder. This would be yet another gang-related killing on Canadian soil, sources said adding that rivalry between Khalistani extremists had been fueling these murders. Reports suggest that Duneke was shot dead by his rivals in Winnipeg area. Duneke, who belonged to Moga in Punjab, was a close associate of designated terrorist Arsh Dalla of the Khalistan Tiger Force. The duo had been trying to resurrect the outfit after the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar by rivals in June this year.
