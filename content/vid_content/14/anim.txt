Taking the reins is his son, Lachlan Murdoch, who will assume the position of the sole chairman for News Corp. Lachlan will also continue to serve as the chair and CEO of Fox. This succession plan was officially confirmed by both companies on Thursday.

This development comes just months after the 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch abandoned a plan that would have brought his media empire back together through the merger of Fox and News Corp. It's worth noting that Murdoch possesses near-controlling stakes in both of these companies.
