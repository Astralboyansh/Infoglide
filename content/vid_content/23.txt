In New Delhi, intelligence sources have reported that Sukhdool Singh, also known as Sukha Duneke, a former gangster turned terrorist, was allegedly assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Canada on Wednesday. Official confirmation of this incident is still pending from local law enforcement, and we await further details. 

This incident marks another in a series of gang-related killings on Canadian soil, with sources indicating that ongoing rivalries among Khalistani extremists have been driving these violent acts. 

Reports suggest that Duneke met his demise at the hands of his adversaries in the Winnipeg area. Hailing from Moga in Punjab, Duneke had close ties to designated terrorist Arsh Dalla, a member of the Khalistan Tiger Force. Together, they had been attempting to revive the organization following the death of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar at the hands of rivals earlier this year.
