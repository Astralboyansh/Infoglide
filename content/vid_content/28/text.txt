Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 launch soon: Expected price, features
Royal Enfield is gearing up to launch a new-generation model of the Himalayan adventure tourer in India, set to arrive later this year. Though official details about the upcoming Himalayan are still under wraps, the motorcycle has been spotted testing across the country, creating a buzz about its specs.
The current-gen Himalayan boasts a 411 cc single-cylinder air-oil cooled engine, churning out 24 hp power. In contrast, the new Himalayan is expected to sport a larger 452 cc liquid-cooled engine, delivering approximately 40 hp of power and 45 Nm of torque. This powerhouse will be paired with a 6-speed gearbox.
Not just the engine, but the 2023 Himalayan will also feature several upgrades. These include a new LED headlamp, a larger digital instrument cluster, upside-down front forks, a redesigned muffler, and a new fuel tank, among other enhancements.
Previous test mules have given us a glimpse of the motorcycle's LED turn indicators, a new rear rack, and dual-purpose tires that seem slightly more road-oriented compared to the current-gen model.
When it comes to color options, expect a range of dual-tone themes, akin to what Royal Enfield offers for the existing Himalayan.
The 2023 Royal Enfield Himalayan is anticipated to be officially unveiled in November, with pricing details to follow shortly after. While the current model starts at Rs 2.16 lakh (ex-showroom), the new Himalayan is expected to command a higher price, given its modern updates, including the new powertrain, platform, suspension setup, and advanced technology.
