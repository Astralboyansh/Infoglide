Air fares to Ahmedabad remain unmatched for Indo-Pak WC match
AHMEDABAD: It is going to be an expensive affair for cricket fans planning to travel to Ahmedabad for the nail-biting India-Pakistan face-off at ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. While hotels are either sold out or are retailing at premium tariffs, there are no signs of air fares dropping either.With 25 days left for the match, air fares for inbound flights to Ahmedabad from across the country have jumped 415%. If you book your tickets 25-30 days in advance, flights from destinations like Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Patna, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, and Pune, among others will cost you anywhere between Rs 5,500 and Rs 12,000 per person for a round trip. However, if you book your tickets to Ahmedabad today for the World Cup matches, you will end up paying anywhere between 104% and 415% more.âVisiting Ahmedabad during the match days will be a costly affair. We know of a few hotels here that have charged as high as Rs 80,000 per room per night in the wake of high demand. With limited frequency, flight fares are bound to go up,â said a city travel operator. Notably, air fares are not so high as yet around other matches i.e., the opening match or even the qualifier and the final. Travel operators have recommended there must be additional flight deployment.âPeople from across the globe, including fans, supporters, sponsors and mediapersons, plan to come for what promises to be an exciting game. Airlines must deploy additional flights to Ahmedabad from October 13-16 to heed to high demand so that passengers arriving or leaving from here get additional benefit,â said Anuj Pathak, president, Travel Agents and Tour Operatorsâ Association of Gujarat (TAG).On the other hand, hotels are all prepared to host cricket fans. âSponsors, cricket fans and VVIPs have booked their stay at the hotel and enthusiasm is reaching a fever pitch. Four matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup being held in the city will bring a lot of revenue for the hospitality sector in Ahmedabad and it will be a good start to the third quarter,â said Keenan McKenzie, general manager, ITC Narmada.We also published the following articles recentlyAhmedabad hotel brings regional, local culinary palette to patronsThe ITC Narmada hotel in Ahmedabad recently hosted a food festival to showcase the regional cuisine from various parts of Gujarat.
