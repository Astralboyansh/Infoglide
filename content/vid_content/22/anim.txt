With just 25 days remaining until the match, airfares for flights into Ahmedabad from all corners of the country have skyrocketed by a staggering 415%. If you plan your trip well in advance, say 25-30 days before the game, round-trip flights from cities like Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Patna, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, and Pune will set you back anywhere from Rs 5,500 to Rs 12,000 per person. However, should you decide to book a flight to Ahmedabad today for the World Cup matches, be prepared to shell out between 104% and 415% more.

"Visiting Ahmedabad during the match days will be a costly affair. We are aware of a few hotels charging as much as Rs 80,000 per room per night due to high demand. Limited flight availability naturally leads to increased fares," noted a local travel operator. Interestingly, airfares for other matches, such as the opening match, qualifier, and final, have not surged to the same extent. Travel experts are recommending additional flight schedules.

"People from all over the world, including fans, supporters, sponsors, and journalists, are planning to attend this highly anticipated game. Airlines should consider adding extra flights to Ahmedabad from October 13-16 to accommodate the high demand, benefiting passengers arriving or departing from the city," emphasized Anuj Pathak, president of the Travel Agents and Tour Operators\u2019 Association of Gujarat (TAG).

Hotels in Ahmedabad are ready to welcome cricket enthusiasts with open arms. "Sponsors, cricket fans, and VVIPs have secured their accommodations, and excitement is at its peak. Hosting four ICC Cricket World Cup matches will bring substantial revenue to Ahmedabad's hospitality sector, marking a strong start to the third quarter," stated Keenan McKenzie, general manager of ITC Narmada.
