According to a D & P Advisory report titled "Beyond 22 Yards \u2013 IPL\u2019s Evolution meets WPL\u2019s Aspiration, an IPL & WPL Valuation report" released on Thursday, the IPL's ecosystem value has surged to $11.2 billion, marking a 3.3% increase from the $10.9 billion recorded in 2022.

Delving into revenue dynamics and value distribution, around 60-65% of this valuation flows to the BCCI, while the remaining 35-40% is distributed among all IPL teams. This translates to a collective business value of approximately $3.9-4.5 billion for all franchises together. Given the league's current composition of 10 franchises, this suggests an average intrinsic business valuation per team in the range of $390-450 million.

The Women's Premier League (WPL) is poised to revolutionize women's cricket in India, mirroring the transformative role the IPL played for men's cricket. The WPL has garnered a noteworthy valuation of Rs 1,250 crore, equivalent to roughly $150 million. While some may draw parallels between the WPL and the IPL, it's essential to acknowledge their distinct structural differences, which directly impact their ecosystem valuations.

The IPL's inaugural season featured 8 teams and 59 matches, whereas the WPL began on a more modest scale with 5 teams and 22 matches. Since the league's value is closely linked to the number of matches played, this scale difference significantly contributes to the valuation variance between the two leagues. This distinction underscores the established market presence and demand that the IPL has enjoyed from the beginning.

The report prioritizes rankings over specific values to mitigate the intrinsic volatility and uncertainty surrounding certain revenue streams, notably merchandising. Notably, the central pool constitutes a substantial portion\u2014about 70-75%\u2014of any individual franchise's overall revenue, ensuring closely aligned intrinsic value for all franchises. This value is rooted in three key parameters: (i) projected cash flows the asset is expected to generate, (ii) the growth trajectory of these cash flows, and (iii) the associated risks affecting the asset's ability to realize these projections.
