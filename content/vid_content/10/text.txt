'India winning global manufacturing battle as supply chains shift away from China'
India's manufacturing achievements on the global stage in the past five years have been impressive, earning it the status of a winner, according to a study by BCG cited in an ET report.
During this period, Indian exports to the US saw a significant surge, totaling $23 billion, marking a substantial 44% increase from 2018 to 2022. In contrast, China experienced a 10% decline in its exports to the US.
The study, titled "Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing," sheds light on the transformation in manufacturing and sourcing across various industries. This shift has been triggered by factors such as trade disputes, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions.
In response, global companies have had to reconsider their manufacturing and sourcing strategies, with India emerging as a favored destination.
The study underscores India's advantage in terms of direct manufacturing costs as an export platform. According to BCG's calculations, the average cost of Indian-made goods imported into the US, considering factory wages, productivity, logistics, tariffs, and energy, is 15% lower compared to goods manufactured in the US.
In contrast, Chinese goods offer only a 4% cost advantage over US-made products and become 21% more expensive when subject to US tariffs related to the trade war.
Specifically, semiconductor and material shipments from India to the US have seen a remarkable 143% increase over the past five years, although starting from a modest base. Meanwhile, China's exports in these categories have decreased by 29%. Furthermore, Indian exports of auto components to the US have risen by 65%, and mechanical machinery exports have grown by 70%.
Ravi Srivastava, the global leader of BCG's operations practice, noted that for the past two decades, there has been talk of India's potential in manufacturing, often with a lingering question mark. Now, it seems that many pieces of the puzzle are falling into place.
Looking ahead, BCG sees potential for India to further enhance its role as a strategic manufacturing and sourcing destination. However, the decision to incorporate India into firms' strategies depends on a complex mix of factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it says.
