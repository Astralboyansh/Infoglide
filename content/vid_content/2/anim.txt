The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting highlighted an incident where a person residing in a foreign country, accused of serious crimes, including terrorism, was invited for a discussion on a television channel. During this discussion, the individual made remarks that could undermine the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the security of India, and its friendly relations with another nation. These comments also had the potential to disrupt public order in the country.

This includes those who face charges of serious crimes and terrorism, as well as those associated with organizations that have been banned by law. This directive is in line with the reasonable restrictions outlined in Article 19(2) of the Constitution and mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the CTN Act."
