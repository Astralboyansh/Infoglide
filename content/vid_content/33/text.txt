Akhil was my soulmate, my better half... I don't know what I'll do without him: Wife Suzanne Bernert
Akhil Mishra, a renowned actor known for his roles in movies like "3 Idiots" and "Don," as well as his appearances in TV shows such as "Do Dil Bandhe Ek Dori Se," "Uttaran," and "Sea Hawks," passed away yesterday at the age of 67. His sudden demise has left his family and friends in shock.
His wife, Suzanne Bernert, also an actress, confirmed the tragic incident. Akhil had a fatal fall from a stool inside their home while no one else was present.
Mandira Bedi, who is set to make her Malayalam cinema debut in the film "Identity" starring Tovino Thomas, expressed her excitement about the project. The action-packed entertainer, directed by Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, promises an exhilarating experience and also features Trisha.
Suzanne, still in a state of shock, revealed, "Akhil was hospitalized last month due to high blood pressure. He had been improving over the past few days, faithfully following his prescribed medication. He even resumed physiotherapy, and everything seemed normal. Although he had refrained from household chores during his illness, as he started feeling better, he insisted on helping me. When I left home yesterday, he assured me he would handle the laundry. A family friend was with him in my absence, but he too had to leave briefly to attend to some personal errands."
Continuing, Suzanne shared, "After our family friend left, Akhil was alone at home. It is possible that while attempting to hang clothes near our kitchen area, he climbed a stool and accidentally slipped and fell. The exact sequence of events remains unclear. When our family friend returned, he discovered Akhil lying on the floor. He rushed him to the hospital, accompanied by our neighbor, who is a doctor. Akhil was still conscious and expressed his love for me, saying he didn't want to go to the hospital. However, the medical team at the hospital discovered that he had suffered internal hemorrhage and had lost a significant amount of blood. Despite their efforts, they couldn't save him, and he passed away in the hospital. A postmortem was conducted, after which his last rites were performed."
The actress, best known for her role in "Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai," had tied the knot with Akhil in 2009. Overwhelmed with grief, Suzanne shared, "Akhil was my soulmate, my better half. He played multiple roles in my life, from being my mentor to assuming the role of a protective father figure. I don't know how I will navigate life without him; I feel utterly lost."
