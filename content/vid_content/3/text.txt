AIADMK wants Modi to become PM again, but ...
NEW DELHI: 
The AIADMK, on Thursday, expressed its desire for Narendra Modi to return as Prime Minister following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Simultaneously, it expects the BJP to endorse party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami as their chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming Tamil Nadu assembly election.
The relationship between the two parties had soured last week when the state BJP chief, Annamalai, criticized Dravidian stalwart CN Annadurai. However, in what seems to be a softening of their stance, senior AIADMK leader and former state minister Sellur K Raju stated today, "We have no issues with BJP leaders like Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and J P Nadda. But we do not appreciate BJP state president K Annamalai insulting our leader C N Annadurai."
"We want Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister again. As for Tamil Nadu, the BJP should acknowledge Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate," he added.
Last week, after Annamalai's remarks about Annadurai, the AIADMK announced that it no longer had an alliance with the BJP in Tamil Nadu. Senior AIADMK leader D Jayakumar remarked, "Annamalai does not desire an alliance. He consistently criticizes our leaders and is unfit to be BJP state president."
"We cannot tolerate continuous criticism of our leaders. Annamalai has previously criticized our leader Jayalalithaa, and we passed a resolution against him at that time. He should have refrained from this. He is criticizing Anna, Periyar, and no cadre would accept this," Jayakumar emphasized.
Annamalai, who is leading a yatra in Tamil Nadu to expand the BJP's influence in the state, has been critical of both the ruling DMK and the AIADMK. The AIADMK hopes that its strong support for the BJP central leadership, including PM Modi, will exert pressure on Annamalai to accept its leadership in the state.
