Amid strains in India-Canada ties, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal met Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday.

Badal, addressing reporters after the meeting, expressed his distress over the challenges faced by Punjabis due to the worsening relations between India and Canada. He stated, "There is a sense of panic among Punjabis. Both governments, India's as well as Canada's, should find a solution as soon as possible."

Badal also highlighted that Sikhs have a history of being patriotic and making significant sacrifices during India's independence struggle. He urged against blaming the entire community for the actions of a few individuals.

Badal emphasized the importance of resolving issues between the two countries rather than allowing them to escalate. He pointed out that there are over 18 lakh Indians in Canada, with a significant number of them being Punjabis.

India took the step of "suspending visa services in Canada until further notice" on Thursday. This move comes amid an escalating diplomatic dispute following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in June. India has firmly rejected this charge as absurd.

The India-Canada ties have been on a downward spiral due to the increasing activities of pro-Khalistani elements in North America. India believes that the Trudeau government is not adequately addressing its genuine concerns.
