NEW DELHI: 
Former Indian cricketer Suresh Raina anticipates that following this year's Men's ODI World Cup, the cricketing world will be buzzing about Shubman Gill, the talented young right-handed batsman.

Gill, who earned the Player of the Tournament title during India's triumphant 2018 Men's U-19 World Cup campaign, has secured his spot in India's squad for the ODIs against Australia and is a crucial member of the team gearing up for the upcoming Men's ODI World Cup on home turf.

This selection is a result of Gill's consistently impressive performances in the format over the past 1.5 years. He recently emerged as the top run-scorer in the Asia Cup, amassing 302 runs in five matches with an impressive average of 75.50 and a strike rate of 93.50.

"He'll be one of the most important players at the World Cup. I know that he wants to be a superstar and wants to be the next Virat Kohli and is in that aura already, and after this World Cup, we will be talking about him more often," said Raina on JioCinema.

The first ODI against Australia on Friday at the PCA Stadium in Mohali holds special significance for Gill, as it marks his debut in playing an international match at his home ground.

Drawing parallels to the past, Raina envisions Gill replicating the kind of batting prowess displayed by captain Rohit Sharma in the 2019 World Cup, where he emerged as the tournament's leading run-scorer.

"The form he's playing in with his hand speed - it's extremely strong. Spinners don't know where to bowl to him, and if fast bowlers don't swing the ball, he can play those really well with a straight or a flick."

"His mindset will not stop here. What Rohit Sharma did in the 2019 World Cup; Gill could do the same for India this year. He'll get 50 overs to bat, so it's a takeoff point for his batting. I think he's a born leader and he shows that in his game."
