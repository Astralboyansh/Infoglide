Asian Games: India keep knockout stage hopes alive with 1-0 win
NEW DELHI: The Indian football team clinched victory over Bangladesh thanks to a late goal by the 39-year-old veteran Sunil Chhetri in a crucial match at the Asian Games in Hangzhou on Thursday.Chhetri found the back of the net from the penalty spot in the 85th minute, securing a solitary goal that kept India's hopes alive for a spot in the tournament's knockout stage. This triumph followed a tough 1-5 defeat against the host nation China just two days earlier.Despite the Bangladesh goalkeeper guessing the right direction, he was unable to stop Chhetri's magnificent penalty kick, as the ball sailed past him into the net.The penalty was awarded to India after a foul committed by Bangladesh captain Rahmat, who impeded Bryce Miranda after a long ball had been delivered to him at the edge of the penalty box.Asked about the lack of recovery time, Chhetri said, "The first thing is to go and recuperate, it was not easy. I'm pretty sure it was the same thing for the opponents also. Playing three games in five days is not easy, a lot of ice baths, eat good food and get ready."India will next play Myanmar, who beat Bangladesh 1-0 on the opening day.India had a great chance of scoring from a free kick after Gurkirat Singh was fouled near the Bangladesh box.Samuel Kynshi took the free-kick after getting some advice from Chhetri, but his shot to the top-left corner was brilliantly saved by the Bangladesh custodian, who dived to palm the ball away.After a goalless first half, India had another chance to score but Rahul KP could not make use of the cross inside the box as he headed it the other way.There were three changes for India as Gurmeet Singh, who received a yellow card in last game, was replaced by Dheeraj Singh. The two other changes were Rohit Danu for Rahim Ali and Chingelsena Singh for Sumit Rathi.(With PTI Inputs)
