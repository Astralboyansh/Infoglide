Rupert Murdoch steps down as chairman of Fox, News Corp
Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul known for his influential career spanning over seven decades, has made a significant announcement. He is stepping down from his role as the chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp, marking the end of an era that saw the creation of a vast media empire stretching from Australia to the United States.
Taking the reins is his son, Lachlan Murdoch, who will assume the position of the sole chairman for News Corp. Lachlan will also continue to serve as the chair and CEO of Fox. This succession plan was officially confirmed by both companies on Thursday.
This development comes just months after the 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch abandoned a plan that would have brought his media empire back together through the merger of Fox and News Corp. It's worth noting that Murdoch possesses near-controlling stakes in both of these companies.
In recognition of his long-standing contributions, Rupert Murdoch will be honored with the title of chairman emeritus for both Fox Corp and News Corp, securing his legacy in the world of media.
