A quick-thinking air hostess onboard the flight bravely sprang into action, enlisting the assistance of fellow passengers to subdue Debnath. Despite their efforts, Debnath continued to misbehave, making repeated attempts to reach the door handle. The other passengers, understandably agitated, resorted to physically restraining him, causing injuries.
