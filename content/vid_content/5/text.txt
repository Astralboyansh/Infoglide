Chandrayaan-3: Isro waiting to hear from Vikram &amp; Pragyan
BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), the organization behind the Chandrayaan-3 mission, recently commanded the lander (Vikram) and rover (Pragyan) to enter sleep mode on September 3. Now, the space agency eagerly awaits to see if these dormant spacecraft will reawaken as the Sun once again casts its light upon the Moon.
"It would have been easy if there was a way we could know if they would wake up, but we have to wait and see how systems behave after Sunrise," Isro chairman S Somanath told TOI.
As Isro patiently anticipates communication from the Chandrayaan-3 lander and rover, the principal investigators have commenced the analysis of data, hopeful for potential new discoveries.
The live-streaming of Chandrayaan-3's soft landing on the Moon garnered 8 million viewers, marking a record high for YouTube. The broadcast included a 16-second clip that showcased various moments from Isro's mission control center in Bengaluru. It captured the entire journey from the start of the broadcast to Chandrayaan-3's successful landing, as well as the excitement and celebrations among Isro staff.
Isro had previously stated that if the systems managed to survive the night on the Moon, the process of waking up would happen automatically.
The sunrise on the Moon occurred early Wednesday, but Vikram and Pragyan would need the right Sun elevation angle to warm up and awaken. "The optimal Sun elevation angle for systems to work would be 6\u00b0 to 9\u00b0. The temperature has to rise above a certain threshold too. For the wake up, we need power generation and temperature on the elements on Vikram and Pragyan to meet certain criteria. We should know something by September 21 or 22. If they wake up, it'll be during this time," said M Sankaran, director of UR Rao Satellite Centre, the Chandrayaan-3 lead center.
Several Isro scientists reiterated that Vikram and Pragyan waking up would be a significant bonus. The data these spacecraft have transmitted while awake is expected to provide new insights, particularly because all earlier in situ experiments were conducted in the Moon's equatorial region.
Both Vikram and Pragyan have successfully fulfilled their primary mission objectives, including soft-landing on the Moon, roving on its surface, and conducting in situ experiments. Notably, Vikram even accomplished a short lunar hop, surpassing the initial mission objectives set by Isro.
