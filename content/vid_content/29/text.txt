India vs Australia: Iyer's fitness, Surya take centre stage
NEW DELHI: 
Team India is gearing up to face Australia in a pivotal three-game series, serving as the final rehearsal before the impending ICC ODI World Cup. With key players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Kuldeep Yadav, and Hardik Pandya resting for the initial matches, it's a critical moment for head coach Rahul Dravid to evaluate India's bench strength.
Amidst this high-stakes encounter, two Mumbai-based batsmen, Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, are engaged in personal battles to secure their spots in the all-important World Cup squad.
KL Rahul, a wicketkeeper-batsman, has been named the captain for the first two games of the upcoming three-match series against Australia. This series serves as a final rehearsal for India ahead of the ODI World Cup.
India's three-game series against Australia will test Shreyas Iyer's fitness and Suryakumar Yadav's ODI record as they prepare for the World Cup. With key players resting for the first two games, head coach Rahul Dravid will assess his bench strength.
Australian cricketer Steve Smith is excited about his return to the team after recovering from a wrist injury.
Shreyas Iyer, at 28, faces a pivotal moment in his career. Limited cricketing action in the last six months due to a stress fracture surgery has raised concerns about his match fitness.
Suryakumar Yadav, known as "SKY," has excelled in T20Is but must prove himself in ODI cricket. Despite having 27 ODIs under his belt, his average of less than 25 raises questions about his suitability in the 50-over format.
The emergence of young talent Tilak Varma adds pressure to Suryakumar's position, and at 33, this may be his final opportunity to feature in a 50-over World Cup.
An unexpected opportunity has arisen for 37-year-old Ravichandran Ashwin due to a small quadriceps tear suffered by left-arm spinner Axar Patel.
Ashwin, who wasn't initially considered, is now competing with Washington Sundar for a spot in the squad. Recent buzz suggests that Ashwin stands a better chance of inclusion compared to Washington.
The absence of Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya provides both Ashwin and Washington with an opportunity to showcase their skills to the team.
It's important to note that even if Ashwin performs well, the team management may opt for Axar if he regains fitness in time for the third ODI. A small tear typically takes around two weeks to heal.
With Rohit Sharma absent from the top order, Ishan Kishan is likely to open alongside Shubman Gill, while Shreyas Iyer fills in for Virat Kohli.
Managing the workload of fast bowlers, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, will be crucial given the tight schedule, including three 50-over games in five days and travel commitments.
Australia, despite a recent series loss to South Africa, remains a formidable team with a strong track record in subcontinental conditions.
India and Australia will clash again on October 8 during the marquee event.
