He mentioned spending several weeks in the hospital due to this condition. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a condition that attacks the nerves and can potentially lead to paralysis.

Stevens credited his brother with bringing him to the hospital when he noticed symptoms that rendered him immobile.

"Last month I woke up one morning and couldn't walk. My hands, arms, and legs were numb and tingling, and I had no strength, no feeling, no mobility. My brother drove me to the ER, and after a series of tests\u2014MRIs, EMGs, cat scans, X-rays, spinal taps (!), echo-cardiograms, etc.\u2014the neurologists diagnosed me with an autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barre Syndrome," Stevens wrote in a post on Instagram.

Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare and serious autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the feet, hands, and limbs. It can cause issues like numbness, weakness, and pain.

The good news is that it can be treated, and most people will fully recover over time. However, in some cases, it can be severe, even life-threatening, and may lead to lasting problems. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome can affect anyone, but it's more common in adults, especially males.

Recovering from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome can be a lengthy process, often taking several years. However, many individuals regain the ability to walk within about six months from when they first experienced symptoms. Some may continue to experience lasting effects like weakness, numbness, or fatigue.

On his recovery, Stevens mentioned on his website, "I'm only in my second week of rehab, but it's going really well, and I'm working really hard to get back on my feet. I'm committed to getting better, I'm in good spirits, and I'm surrounded by a really great team. I want to be well!"

The onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is rather sudden, as Stevens described it, "Last month I woke up one morning and couldn't walk."

Symptoms may include a pins-and-needles sensation in fingers, toes, ankles, or wrists, along with weakness starting in the legs and possibly spreading to the upper body. It might feel as if small ants are biting or crawling up your fingers or toes. This can lead to unsteady walking, making it difficult to climb stairs or even walk. Additionally, challenges with facial movements may affect speech, chewing, or swallowing, and vision problems or difficulty moving your eyes may occur. Managing bladder or bowel functions may become tough, and there might be changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

If any of the above conditions sound or feel familiar to you or someone around you, it's advisable to consult a medical professional.

Is there a cure? According to NHS UK, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are the primary treatments for this autoimmune disorder. Stevens mentioned, "Luckily there's treatment for this\u2014they administer immuno-hemoglobin infusions for five days and pray that the disease doesn't spread to the lungs, heart, and brain. I am now undergoing intensive physical therapy/occupational therapy, strength building, etc. to get my body back in shape and to learn to walk again. It's a slow process, but they say I will 'recover,' it just takes a lot of time, patience, and hard work."
