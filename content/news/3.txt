AIADMK wants Modi to become PM again, but ...
NEW DELHI: The AIADMK on Thursday said it wants Narendra Modi to return again as PM after 2024 Lok Sabha elections but also expects the BJP to accept party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami as their chief ministerial candidate in the next Tamil Nadu assembly election.The relation between the two parties had strained last week after state BJP chief Annamalai had attacked Dravidian stalwart CN Annadurai.However, in what appeared to be a softening of stance, senior AIADMK leader and former state minister Sellur K Raju today said, "We have nothing against BJP leaders like Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and J P Nadda. But we don't relish BJP state president (K Annamalai) insulting our leader C N Annadurai.""We want Narendra Modi to become prime minister again. And as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, the BJP should accept Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate," he added.Last week after Annamalai's remarks on Annadurai, the AIADMK had announced that it does not have an alliance with the BJP in Tamil Nadu.Senior AIADMK leader D Jayakumar had said: "Annamalai doesn't want an alliance. He always criticises our leaders. He is unfit to be BJP state president.""We can't accept continuous criticism on our leaders. Annamalai already criticised our leader Jayalalithaa. At that time, we passed a resolution against Annamalai. He should have stopped this. He is criticising Anna, Periyar. No cadre would accept this," Jayakumar had added.Annamalai who has undertaken a yatra in Tamil Nadu to spread the base of the BJP in the state has been attacking both the ruling DMK and the AIADMK. The AIADMK would hope that its strong backing for the BJP central leadership, including PM Modi, will put Annamalai under pressure to accept its leadership in the state.(With inputs from agencies)
