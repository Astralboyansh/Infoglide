'Is Kohli batting more freely now?': Here's what India spinner has to say
NEW DELHI: India's run-machine Virat Kohli is back to his best ahead of the ICC ODI World Cup, which begins next month. Virat, who for years carried the dual responsibilities of captaincy and batting, has undergone significant changes in his batting approach recently. He's become more daring, taking calculated risks and his hunger for big runs is also back.One unforgettable moment in this post-captaincy phase was his iconic innings against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, where he played a stunning unbeaten knock of 82* off 53 balls, one of the finest performances of his career.Read AlsoIndia Squad vs Australia 2023: R Ashwin makes comeback; Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya rested for first two ODIsSeasoned spinner R Ashwin on Monday made a comeback to the Indian ODI team for the 3-match series against Australia while senior players including skipper Rohit Sharma and senior batter Virat Kohli were rested from the first two games.

Since he has quit his captaincy and Rohit became the captain, Virat is playing freely. He is now focussing and concentrating on his batting. With this, there is a lot of improvement in his batting,â Mishra, who is a cricket expert for JioCinema, told Timesofindia.com in an interview. "When you are a captain, you have to focus on both aspects - your team and your batting. Now Virat is no longer a captain and his sole focus is on his batting. Since he left the captaincy, his batting has improved. He is the same Virat we saw a few years back [before the lean phase]. He is giving the same glimpse," Mishra said.(AP Photo)Virat stepped down from T20I captaincy after the conclusion of the T20 World Cup in October 2021 and was then relieved from ODI captaincy ahead of the South Africa tour in December later that year. Virat gave up Test captaincy less than 24 hours after India lost a series in South Africa in January 2022."Virat is enjoying his batting, scoring runs, always smiling, having fun on the field, and speaking to other team members. He is in a very good frame of mind currently," Mishra added.

They can sit, think, and plan for a big tournament like the World Cup. They need to be relaxed, focused, and mentally charged up for the World Cup," Mishra further told TimesofIndia.com."This break was very important for them because they will be getting a lot of mental stress in the World Cup. So, this break was important for them. Virat and Rohit have been rested so that they can be mentally and physically ready for the World Cup. The World Cup is very important for them," the spinner said.
